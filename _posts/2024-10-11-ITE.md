We held the first committee meeting of the ITE RPI Student Chapter today! During the meeting, we discussed the chapter's bylaw, clarified leadership roles, and set our goals for the semester. The chapter will be led by Gwen Coyne (President), Faisal Safi (Vice President), Kyla Levin (Secretary), and Kaliyah Evans (Treasurer). Special thanks to Dr. Xiaoyu Ma for her tremendous efforts in helping establish this chapter.
