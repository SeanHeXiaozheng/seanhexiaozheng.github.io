Grateful for the invitation from Prof. Peeta to give a talk to Autonomous & Connected Transportation (ACT) Lab at Georgia Tech! Dr. He had the pleasure of sharing insights on _Toward Resilient Connected-Vehicle Systems: From Cybersecurity to Strategic Information Provision_. It was fantastic to reconnect with friends and discuss overlapping research interestsâ€”looking forward to future collaborations!
